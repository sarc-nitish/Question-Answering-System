# Question Answering System using MDeBERTa

This is a robust Question Answering (QA) web application developed using **Hugging Face Transformers** and **Streamlit** as part of the **DevifyX NLP Job Assignment**. It allows users to input a context paragraph and ask natural language questions. The system extracts the most relevant answer span from the context using a powerful transformer model.

---

##  Model Used

* **Model**: `timpal0l/mdeberta-v3-base-squad2`
* **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers
* **Accuracy**: Very high on SQuAD2.0
* **Justification**: MDeBERTa-v3 is one of the most accurate models for extractive QA and handles unanswerable questions well.

##  Features

### Core Features

*  Accepts paragraph (context) and question as input
*  Extracts the most relevant answer from the context
*  Confidence score displayed for the predicted answer
*  Error handling for empty inputs or irrelevant questions
*  Relevance check between question and context (keyword overlap)

### Bonus Features (Implemented)

*  Highlights extracted answer inside the context
*  Score-based answer reliability classification
*  Streamlit web-based UI for interactive use
